It was a frigid, summer's day. Billy Willy was really silly walking outside with out his jacket. Billy's mother, Milly Willy proclaimed, "Billy Willy you're so silly, putting me in a tilly because it is so chilly".
 
Billy Willy refused to get his jacket and his mother was angry. She confiscated his PS4 game console.

After having his gaming console confiscated Billy Willy was angry. He couldn't g online on his PSN  anymore, and play Fornite with his buddies. It was a bummer becuase Billy Willy wanted to practice for a big tournament comming up.
