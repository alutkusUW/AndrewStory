It was a frigid, summer's day. Billy Willy was really silly walking outside with out his jacket. Billy's mother, Milly Willy proclaimed, "Billy Willy you're so silly, putting me in a tilly because it is so chilly".
 
Billy Willy refused to get his jacket and his mother was angry. She confiscated his PS4 game console.

After having his gaming console confiscated Billy Willy was angry. He couldn't g online on his PSN  anymore, and play Fornite with his buddies. It was a bummer becuase Billy Willy wanted to practice for a big tournament comming up.

All of a sudden, Billy Willy's mother started yelling at him again:"Billy, today is your uncle's birthday! Go get yourself dressed so we can celebrate together with him!"

Billy Willy reluctantly removed his butt from the bed, murmuring, "Why would I care, he hasn't been nice to me ever since I was born. And plus, he is dull, always talking about science stuff."

After what Billy considers a very long day, he hugs his mother Milly Willy, goodnight. Biily looks forward to waking up in the morning and forgetting his jacket all over again.
