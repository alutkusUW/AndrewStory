It was a frigid, summer's day. Billy Willy was really silly walking outside with out his jacket. Billy's mother, Milly Willy proclaimed, "Billy Willy you're so silly, putting me in a tilly because it is so chilly" 
Billy Willy refused to get his jacket and his mother was angry. She confiscated his PS4 game console.
